Static and Dynamic arrays <--->
In java arrays are always located on heap -> int[] arr = new int[n]

Dynamic arrays in java ---> ArrayList (resize automatically)
Insert at end for static arrays - 0(1)
Insert at beg/avg for static arrays - 0(n)

Insert at end for dynamic arrays - 0(1) #We take copying arrays elements and creating a doubly sized array into account and still it is 0(1)
